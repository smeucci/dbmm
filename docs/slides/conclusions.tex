\begin{tframe}{Conclusions}

The implemented procedure presents some limitations:

\begin{itemize}
\item The collection phase is not reliable.
\item The duplicate removal phase is only able to remove perfect duplicate.
\item Having more than one detected face in an image can lead to a training set for the classification that contains errors, negatively affecting the computed model.
\item Some identities can lead to ambiguous results in the image search engine.
\end{itemize}
