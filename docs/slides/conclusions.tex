\begin{tframe}{Conclusions}

The implemented procedure presents some limitations:

\begin{itemize}
\item The collection phase is not reliable.
\item The duplicate removal phase is only able to remove perfect duplicate.
\item Having more than one faces in an image can lead to a training set for the classification that contains error, negatively affecting the computed model.
\item An identity can have a name that leads to bad results in the search.
\end{itemize}
