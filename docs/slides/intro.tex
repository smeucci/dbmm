\begin{tframe}{Introduction}

\textbf{Objective}: the creation of a procedure, based on the work of [1], thanks to which build a large dataset of images of faces that can be used in the training process of a \textbf{CNN}.

\vspace{0.1in}

This procedure takes advantage of the modern \textbf{search engines}, and, at the same time, has the objective of decreasing at a minimum the cost in terms of human time necessary to the acquisition and annotations of the images of the dataset.

\begin{tframe}{Introduction}

The proposed method is divided in phases, as follows:

\begin{itemize}
\item A \textbf{dataset creation} phases, by exploiting modern search engines.
\item Detect the faces inside the downloaded images thanks to a \textbf{face detector}.
\item A \textbf{duplicate removal} phase, thanks to which identical duplicate images are removed.
\item A \textbf{classification} phase, to determine if the faces are correctly associated to an identity.
\item A \textbf{visual validation} phase, done by a user with the help of a web application.
\end{itemize}
